**JobLogger**


The code is used to log different messages throughout an application. 
We want the ability to be able to log to a text file, the console and/or the database. 
Messages can be marked as message, warning or error. 
We also want the ability to selectively be able to choose what gets logged, such as to be able to log only errors or only errors and warnings.
